	Recommended Routes;
		Bridge; 
			if Triple (right side); Dowsky
			if Single (right side); 11tb Dip

		Treaure; 
			NinjaBrain

		Housing; 
			if Top; Top Down Manhunt
			if Bottom; Manhunt

		Stables;
			if Triple; Triple Gold -> Triple Chest -> Good Gap/2nd Triple (if needed)
			if no Triple, w/ Good Gap; Good Bottom
			if Bad/Bad + no Triple; Reset

	Identification:
		Bridge - https://imgur.com/a/OHwW0tb
			Large Bridge in the middle with 16 Gold Blocks in a Stack on top
			In the center, there are 5 Lava Flows on each side of the Bridge
			Beyond each side is a Rampart, with a chance to spawn Chests in the upper area

		Treasure - https://imgur.com/gallery/U4FnQC5
			Main Building has a Magma Spawner + a pile of Gold Blocks next to it (bad side)
			2 Identical Ramparts are townhoused together on the opposite side of the Bastion (good side)
			Between the 2 Structures is a Small bridge, situated over 10 segmented lava pools (start here)
				if you're inside, the bridge to the Ramparts is located at the top of the Treasure area
				on the side with the staircase (opposite of the Spawner); https://i.imgur.com/yGngvi4.jpeg
			bottom placements: https://i.imgur.com/k0VMRTd.jpeg
				3 blocks below the divider; dig into wall for chest (2-4 all work, 3 is easiest)
				3 blocks above the divider; tower up to the bridge (0 to 3 work, 3 is the max)

		Housing - https://imgur.com/gallery/wyjWcli
			Short Section; Scattered housing structures, with Soul Sand in the middle open area
				if the Lower Section is covered in Blocks, find the Rampart by the Soul Sand formation
				view the longest line of Soul Sand on the right; https://youtu.be/BoNr-pbEITM?t=853
			Tall Section; 2 Ramparts, the Main Rampart is always the same, it has 9 Gold Blocks + Triple Chest

		Stables - https://imgur.com/gallery/u91rHC4
			Short Section; 2 open Structures, separated by 2 air blocks with 3 pillars inbetween
				lots of Lava on the ground, many holes in the walls, and Hoglins everywhere (avoid)
				if you're having trouble finding the Ramparts from the Lower Section, use the Pillars
					1 Pillar on the left, 2 Pillars on the right; https://youtu.be/TioQsF5ygOg?t=1695
			Tall Section; 3 RNG Ramparts, with a Top and Bottom half, (both with 3 possible formations)
				Top; Large(Triple Chest) | Medium(Lantern Chest) | Small(Diagonal Chest)
					All 3 Rampart Tops are random, and they can all be the same type of top
				Bot; Good(7-10 Gold Blocks) | Bad(1 chest) | Open Stairs(1 chest) |
					identify by Gaps; good(1high,3wide) | bad(2high,2wide) | open(no gap)
						The Middle Ramparts bottom will always be the Open Stairs variant
						The Left/Right Ramparts can be either Good or Bad (gg/bb/gb/bg)
					if the Rampart's Top is Medium, the Gap will be covered in Netherrack either,
					mine it out, or detect the Gap from the inside; https://youtu.be/AczOTF5QpZ4?t=164



~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~- Speedrun Guide -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
[Beginner] Structureless Overworld: Slower, but fewer resets - https://youtu.be/7dOca1LHefk
	Gather 3 Wood -> 12 Planks -> Crafting Table + 8 Sticks
	Find a nearby Cave, go down until you find Iron -> Place Crafting Table -> Craft Wooden Pickaxe
		Mine 3 Cobblestone -> Craft Stone Pickaxe -> Mine 7 Iron (8 if Shield) + 12 Cobblestone + 1 Coal
		Craft Furnace + Stone Axe + Stone Shovel, Pickup Crafting Table
		Resurface, Place Furance @ Tree, Smelt Iron -> Chop 8+ Wood
			Collect the first Iron Ingot -> Search for Gravel, dig for Flint -> Craft Flint and Steel
				Kill burning animals to get pre-cooked meat and search for Dandelions/Blue Orchids
			Once the Iron is done, place Crafting Table -> Craft Iron Pickaxe + Bucket + Boat + Bowls
	Find a nearby Lava Lake, or dig in the cave to find Lava -> Create Nether Portal -> Enter the Nether;
		Collect Mushrooms for Stews (Dandelion Stew gives a Saturation Buff); https://i.imgur.com/9ckpeB6.png


[Standard] Village Overworld: Village Spawn | Ideally Plains, Savanna, or Desert for Hay Bales
	if Desert Village; Grab Wood / Stone before going into the Village (their buildings don't use wood)
	Gather 3 Wood -> 12 Planks -> Crafting Table + 8 Sticks
		Place Crafting Table @ Mining Destination -> Craft Wooden Pickaxe -> 
			Mine 6 Stone -> Craft Stone Shovel + Axe + Hoe -> Pickup Crafting Table -> Chop 8+ Wood

	Village Tasks:
		Loot Blacksmiths, if available;
			if 10+ Obsidian;
				Skip Bucket; 4 Stone, Skip Hoe (slightly slower, but doesn't require a second stick craft)
			if 3+ Iron Ingots; 2 Wood Start, Skip Wooden Pickaxe
				if 7+ Total (Blacksmith+Golem), can skip Bucket Trade (can do with 6, if Flintless Portal)

		Collect Beds from Village Houses (+Carpets, if Carpet Flintless Portal)

		Kill the Golem for 3-5 Iron Ingots;
			Hit the Golem (from behind) -> Run a few Blocks away -> Build up 3 Blocks (Wood Planks) ->
				Crit the Golem 8-9 times to Kill it; Jump -> Fall -> Attack (Stone Hatchet)

		Place Crafting Table -> Craft Iron Pickaxe, Boat, (+Composter/Barrel if doing Bucket Trade)
			if 4 Iron Ingots; Craft Flint and Steel (after getting Flint from digging up Gravel)
				if you only get 3 Iron Ingots, you can search for a Shipwreck/Ruined Portal
				or learn Flintless Portal; Turn on Hard Difficulty -> Back to Easy when the Portal Lights
					Teaching Video; https://youtu.be/axHdNQtPOf8?t=66
					More Strats; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVDbfKuLaWo
			if 5 Iron Ingots; Craft Shield, useful for Fortress before Bastion Nethers

		Hoe 7 Hay Bales -> 7:63 Wheat -> Hoe 7 additional Hay Bales -> Bucket Trade;
			Find or Craft Composter (7 Wood Slabs)
				Turn a Villager into a Farmer; Trade Wheat 60:3 Emeralds
			Find or Craft Barrel (6 Wood Planks + 2 Wood Slabs)
				Turn a Villager into a Fisherman; Trade Emeralds 3:1 Bucket of Cod

		Craft Hay bales -> Wheat -> Bread -> Pickup Crafting Table
			
	Leave the Village and Search for a Lava Lake -> Create a Nether Portal -> Enter the Nether;
		Nether Portal, Standard Method; https://youtu.be/iaUF0oaegns?t=2029
			Minimum Blocks Needed: https://i.imgur.com/jSspUON.png
			Minimum Space Needed: https://i.imgur.com/GKtJlok.png


[Advanced] Pirate Overworld: Ocean Spawn | Requires a nearby Shipwreck with 7+ Iron Ingots (Ideally 11+)
	Gather 3 Wood -> 12 Planks -> Crafting Table + 8 Sticks
		Place Crafting Table @ Tree -> Craft Wooden Axe -> Chop 8+ Wood ->
			Craft Doors -> Craft Boat -> Pickup Crafting Table ->
				Place Boat in the Ocean -> Search for a Shipwreck (don't forget to grab the Boat when you dive)

	Once you find a Shipwreck, go to the Top side @ the Back of the Boat -> Loot Chest;
		if <7 iron; Grab the Buried Treasure Map and locate the Buried Treasure, if bad Loot -> Reset
		you can use the Door in the Chest room to refresh your breath meter

	Swim to the nearest Gravel -> Place Crafting Table @ Ocean floor -> Place Door on top of the Table ->
		Craft Iron Pickaxe, Bucket, (if 8+ Iron; Iron Shovel, else; Wood/Stone Shovel), (if 11+ Iron; Iron Axe) ->
			if Gold Ingots, can get Gold Shovel (allowing you to get Iron Axe with 10 Iron)
			if any Iron Ingots remain, Craft Shield (if wanted), and Iron Armor
			Dig up Gravel for Flint -> Craft Flint and Steel -> Pickup Crafting Table

	Resurface -> Place Boat -> Search for an Ocean Ravine -> Ravine Nether Portal: 
		Standard: https://youtu.be/yGyMWYhHYoQ
		Cobble Skip: https://youtu.be/H2fHDidyfJo?t=63
		2-Wide: https://youtu.be/K233ih6nSCU?t=94 (not really a guide)
	When searching for an Ocean Ravine, turn on Entity Hitboxes (F3 + B), and look for floating Kelp

	You wont have any Beds, Make sure you get enough String from Trades: 7 Beds = 84 String (+21 Planks)
	You wont have much Food, Nether: Make Stews or kill burning Hoglins | Overworld: kill burning Animals
		Nether: 6 Crying Obsidian + 3 Glowstone (12 Dust) = Respawn Anchor -> Suicide to Reset HP/Hunger
		Overworld: Before entering The End, Sleep at a Bed -> Suicide to Reset HP/Hunger (if no food)
		Suicide Methods; use any Method that seems convienent to you at the time
			Fire: Burn yourself with Flint and Steel or Lava, (Put out the Fire, so you don't burn any Items)
			Ender Pearl: if you have excess Pearls, throw into a nearby Wall/Floor, taking damage on impact
			Fall Damage: 1/2 Heart per Block above 3 (4: 1/2 | 7: 2 | 15: 6 etc),
				in the Stronghold, you can easily climb up the Starter Staircase for some height


[Advanced] Pirate + Monument: Ocean Spawn | Requires a nearby Ocean Monument (Requires Deep Ocean)
		Guide: https://youtu.be/14FGC1eUHug | https://youtu.be/-b7nQyXZkfw | https://youtu.be/0dyHYkg_xIU
	Uses the same strats as Pirate Overworld, but you also go to an Ocean Monument, to collect 
		the guaranteed 8 Gold Blocks, allowing you to completely skip the Bastion in the Nether

	Pirate Start (Boat/Doors/Blocks) -> Shipwreck (Iron Pickaxe/Bucket) -> Ocean Monument
	Once you Locate the Ocean Monument, turn your Render Distance to the lowest (RD2), this will cause
		the Elder Guardian to not spawn most of the time, stopping you from getting Mining Fatigue
			if you get Mining Fatigue, either drink a Bucket of Milk, or set your Spawn and Suicide
	Guardian Laser; Hits to kill, -healing (Damage/20); Easy = 5 (4) | Normal = 4 (6) | Hard = 3 (9)
		with healing, easy will almost always take 6 hits, and normal will sometimes take 5

	Once you're a reasonable distance away from the Monument, turn your Render Distance back up
	Continue with the normal Pirate Overworld strats -> Ravine Nether Portal -> Enter the Nether


[Expert] Hypermodern: Combination of the most optimal strats, high reset efficiency; https://youtu.be/gAHMJfsrHe4
	Pirate -> Ravine Nether Entry -> Microlensing -> Bastion Routing -> Pie-Ray ->
		Fortress -> Blazebed -> Blind/Divine Travel (if 20+ Obsidian; Educated/Calculated) -> Triangulation -> 
			Stronghold Staircase Entry (if Ocean exposed, Portal Room) -> Stronghold Navigation -> 
				End Entry -> Half-Bow + N/S Ground + One-Cycle Dragon

	Optionally; Villages starts, if you have a close Lava Pool / Ruined Portal / Blacksmith (with 10+ Obsidian)
		if >= 7 Iron (Blacksmith + Golem); Iron Pickaxe + Bucket + Flint and Steel
		if 4-6 Iron; Skip Iron Pickaxe, try to get lucky with Bastion Chests
			if 3 Iron, Reset (or Flintless Portal, if you really want to force the seed)



The Nether: Bastion, Trade Gold to Piglins for Obsidian/Ender Pearls | Fortress, Kill Blazes for Blaze Rods
	Use Boats to negate Fall Damage, and kill burning Hoglins for easy Food; https://youtu.be/REas9cmjlic?t=686
		Lava Bucket Hoglin killing Method; https://youtu.be/iaUF0oaegns?t=3860

	Only 1 Structure can Spawn per 432, 432 MegaChunk, for Example:
		if Bastion @ +x,+z you will have to go to any of the remaining three quadrants; +x,-z | -x,-z | -x,+z
			aka; pos, pos | pos, neg | neg, neg | neg, pos
		in order to find a Fortress (or another Bastion), go to whatever direction is closer to x0/y0
		you can also go out beyond +/- 432 x or z to go into a new MegaChunk, but this may take awhile

	Bastion: if you can, do the Bastion first - Trading has a chance to give you Fire Resistance Potions
		Identify the Bastion Type, and run the route accordingly
		Mine Gold Blocks -> Turn into Gold Ingots -> Trap Piglins in a hole -> Trade with Piglins;
			While the Piglins Trade; Loot Chests | Pie-Ray for Fortress Location, if Bastion first
			@10+ Obsidian, @16+ Ender Pearls; Leave for Fortress (if close to 20 Obsidian, you should wait)
				Optional Items; Not necessary for the run, but can make it easier
					Fire Resistance Potion; Makes you Immune to Lava / Blaze Fire damage (Not Melee)
						if multiple Potions; use one now, to avoid accidental Lava damage
					Iron (nuggets/ingots) Craft Iron Axe (if Flintless Portal, Craft Flint and Steel first)
					String; Beds (not really optional), Fishing Rod (grab roaming Blazes), Bow (see below)
					(Cross)Bow + Arrows; Half-Bow Dragon Fight, https://youtu.be/whwjNbIni58

	Fortress: https://youtu.be/iaUF0oaegns?t=3624
		Fortress Navigation: Blaze Spawners only generate in the Outside portion of the Fortress
			The Inside section will have a Netherbrick roof
			The Outside section will either have no roof, or a Netherrack/Soul Sand roof
			if looking down from above, the structure without a roof entrance leads to the open area
				if you're inside the Fortress, this room has a 1x1 pool of Lava in the middle
			Inside Navigation:
				if staircase with Netherwart at the bottom; go down the stairs
				if staircase with no Netherwart; go up the stairs
				if balcony room; go in the opposite direction of the balcony		

		When entering a Fortress, change your Render Distance to 5 (RD5), increasing nearby enemy spawns rates
			this wont change the spawn rate from Blaze Spawners, but will increase naturally spawning blazes
		Locate a Blaze Spawner -> Drink/Throw Fire Resistance Potion (if acquired) -> Kill Blazes;
			Loot atleast 7/8 Blaze Rods, you can Mine out around the Blaze Spawner to increase spawn rates
				Learn how to efficiently Blazebed; (put out Fires ASAP, Blazes only spawn @ Light level <= 11)
					Blazebed; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TD4jkuT8QA
					BlazeTnT; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3kHn0PaZW0 (suboptimal?)

	Advanced Nether Scouting Methods; saves a significant amount of time, while not being all that hard to learn
		Microlensing; Locating Bastions based on the E value in the F3 Menu
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvTfMLPnMSw
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou58P7e-ZY0
		Pie-Ray; Locating Fortresses based on Blaze Spawner Entities in the Shift+F3 Pie Chart
			keep in mind, Treasure Bastions also have a Spawner, sometimes causing a false positive
			to quickly update the pie chart, find RD, -RD4, +RD3 (use keybinds; Shift + F3 + f, F3 + f)
			https://youtu.be/Ou58P7e-ZY0?t=109 (same video as above)
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9qfHNEOHM

	Blind Travel: Optimal Nether Coordinates, y = 64+
		First Ring; https://i.imgur.com/96KhbT2.png
		1st/2nd/3rd; https://imgur.com/gallery/i3fIanf
	Educated/Calculated Travel: Requires 20+ Obsidian, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N8Wj8hOVKM
		Educated = Throw 1 Eye, then Blind at ~normal Coordinates in the correct direction
		Calculated = Throw 2 Eyes, Triangulate the Stronghold's distance for a better Blind
			Axis Calculated Guide (very precise calculated travel); https://youtu.be/0LDj48fsRT8


The Overworld, Part 2: Find the Location of the Stronghold, Navigate to the Portal Room, and enter The End
	Stronghold Navigation: Minimum 1400 Blocks away from 0,0 (~175 in the Nether, since Distance is 8:1)
		This is calculated Triangularly not linearly, so a²+b²=c², not a+b=c | 150x,150z = 212, not 300
			Generally if you're just adding x+z, 2000-2400 for The Overworld, 250-300 for the Nether

	Triangulation: Throwing multiple Eyes and calculating their angle differences to find the Stronghold
		Simple Methods; 
			17.5 Block Method - Makes ° calc very simple (1000 / x° = distance)
				https://i.imgur.com/6rvw5Bb.png
				https://i.imgur.com/uutGOSx.png
				https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c29j0We2VQ
			20 Block Method - Easier to move 20 blocks instead of 17.5, but makes the math harder
				https://i.imgur.com/vZAaWp8.png
				https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgRTgPTzoXU
		Indepth Explainations;
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy7XEr-zl_A
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkv2Jb-8Oqo
		NinjaBrain Axis Calculated, (can be used for general Triangulation); https://youtu.be/0LDj48fsRT8
		Change FoV to 30 when Recording the Angle for a more precise Triangulation;
			Either go to 30 FoV at the start, and back to your normal FoV after Triangulation, or
			Throw Eye -> Look @ Eye -> FoV: 30 -> Record ° -> FoV: Reset -> Move -> Repeat for Second Eye
				It could also be useful to go into Third Person View when throwing the Eye (default F5)
				to make sure you know which direction it flew, (still look at the Eye in First Person View)
				if you don't want to use F5, you could also just look at the ground when you throw
		Locate the Stronghold; when close, do another Triangulation near the Stronghold to find the exact Chunk

	Enter the Stronghold
		if Entering from above, Dig @ 4/x/4 (3,4,5/x/3,4,5 all work) in the Chunk to enter the Starter Staircase
		if not entering @ the Starter Staircase; Go through Backwards Doors until you find it
		Portal Room is usually within 5-7 rooms of the Starter Staircase
		on entering the Portal Room, run up the stairs -> place a block in the lava -> stand on it ->
			Place Eyes of Ender into the End Portal Frames, on the final Frame, you will be teleported to The End



The End: Kill the Ender Dragon, Finish the Game; 
		End Guide: https://youtu.be/-Ta_1R1aXvA
		In-depth explainations: https://youtu.be/1daiTbj1OiE
		One-Cycle Tips: 
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGMLHXnD6Bc
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBp8uVbW1us

	You always Spawn to the East, facing the Main Island, Ender pearl to the Island if possible
		if you spawn underground, Dig up in the top left/right corner

	Get to the Fountain asap -> setup the bed platform -> run in your desired direction
		The Dragon Perches faster the futher away you are from the fountain
		Run away in a Cardinal Direction, in relation to the fountain
			if you don't, the dragon might Diagonal Perch, making the one cycle very hard
		North/South Perch is faster than East/West, but gives the player less time to react
		The Dragon will Perch on the Opposite side of you;
			so if you're North, and the dragon snaps middle from the South, it's likely perching
	if 2+ Pearls; Pearl to the highest tower in your desired direction (N/S/E/W), build up to y = 122
		if the Dragon fireballs you, either dodge it, or get hit on purpose then jump -> place a block below you
	F3 + B to enable Hitboxes for the Dragon fight, also helps with recognizing the Perch
	When the Dragon starts to Perch, Pearl/Run to the fountain and Kill it with beds





~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~- Keybinds & Shortcuts -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
F3 Keybinds: F3 + Q = Shows most F3 Commands in-game 
	F3+F4 = Game Mode Selection (Open to LAN -> Allow Cheats: ON -> Start LAN World -> F3+F4), after a Failed Run
	F3 = Standard F3 Menu
	F3 + G = Chunk Borders
	F3 + B = Hitboxes
	Useful for Pie-ray scouting; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9qfHNEOHM
		Shift + F3 = Pie Chart F3 Menu (Tick -> Level -> Entites -> Block Entites)
		F3 + F = Increase Render Distance by 1
		F3 + Shift + F = Decrease Render Distance by 1
		
Inventory Management: (Storage Interface = Chest, Crafting Table etc)
	Hotbar Swap; Swaps the Hotbar Slot's Item with the Item Slot on your Mouse Hover
		Hover over an Item Slot, and press a Hotbar Hotkey (1,2,3 etc)
		(this can be used to quickly move items into the Crafting Window, with minimal mouse movement)
	Pick Block; Selects the Block you're currently looking at, if you have any in your Inventory
		Press the Pick Block Keybind (default Middle Mouse Button)
		(this is very useful for one cycling the Dragon with Beds)
	Drop Stack; Drops the entire stack of either a Selected, or Hovered Item Slot
		Control + Drop Item Keybind (default Q), if Inventory is opened, drop Hovered | if closed, drop Selected
	Transfer Item; Shift + Click (left or right, both work) Sends an Item To/From your Hotbar/Inventory
		(if a Storage Interface is open, then you will Transfer between that and your Inventory instead)
	Equip Item; Puts an equipable Item on your Character's corresponding equipment Slot
		if Inventory is closed, select in Hotbar -> Right Click | if open, Transfer Item (Shift + Click)
		(both of these methods require the Slot to be currently empty, if it's filled, you need to manually equip)
	Half Split; Selects half the Stack of an Item, leaving the other half in the Slot you Selected it from
		Right Click an item in an Item Slot (while not currently having anything Selected)
	Drag Split 1; Split off 1 Item into each Slot that you Drag over
		Select an Item -> Hold Right Click -> Drag (Press Left Click to Undo the current Split)
	Drag Split x; Equally Split a Stack of Items between multiple Slots (Stack of 30: 2x15, 3x10, 4x7(+2) etc)
		Select an Item -> Hold Left Click -> Drag (Press Right Click to Undo the current Split)
	Select all of Item Type; Combine all Stacks of a type of Item into 1 Stack (Max Stack Limits still apply)
		if nothing is Selected, Double Left Click | if the same Item Type is Selected, Triple Left Click
		(this will not work if you have an unrelated Item Selected, you will simply switch the selection)
	Transfer all of Item Type; Sends all Items of the same Type between Storage Interfaces and your Inventory
		(Inventory/Crafting wont put items in your Hotbar, Chests will prioritize your Hotbar, for some reason)
		with an Item Selected (a selection IS required), Shift + Double left Click 
		(your current selection will not be transfered, use an unrelated Item to be sure to Transfer all)



~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~- Tips & Tricks -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
The Overworld:
	Shipwrecks; Front = Food | Back = Top: Iron/Gold, Bot: Treasure Maps
		Buried Treasure always spawns @ 9/x/9 in the chunk where the X is located
	Desert Temples: Clear the Chests + surrounding Blocks with 1 TnT: https://youtu.be/gS6LxaNibWM?t=76
		Grab TnT -> Place 1 up top (in a corner) -> Pressure Plate next to it -> Activate -> Crouch in the hole
	Stone is slightly faster to Mine than Cobblestone (found as part of houses in Plains Villages)
	Why 8+ Wood @ Overworld 1, after crafting Stone Tools; More is fine, less is risky
		W=Wood,P=Plank [8W=32P: 12P Left,(6P if Shield) | if Flintless: 0P], (+1P, Pickaxe Leftover)
		2W -> 8P, 6P -> 12 Slabs | 9|10 Needed, [-7(composter), -2(barrel), -1,Optional(slab dragon)]
		4W -> 16P, 14P -> [-6(barrel), -5(boat), -3(golem tower)]
			if Flintless; 2W -> 8P(+4 Leftover = 12P), https://i.imgur.com/wyPQ9Sb.png
	if you can't find a Lava Lake on the surface, try to dig near Small Water Lakes (Lava tends to spawn below)
	if searching for Ocean Ravines, try to find Kelp, as it tends to spawn above Ravines
		floating kelp in an Ocean is an ever larger indicator; https://youtu.be/yGyMWYhHYoQ?t=471
	How to stop glitchy buckets, when making Nether Portals; https://youtu.be/EjwStTX4U3A
	Water Bucket is useless in the Nether, after making your Nether Portal, grab Lava (grab Water in Overworld 2)

The Nether:
	While in the Nether, Mine Netherrack (Pickaxe) for some fast and easy blocks
	if a far away Ghast is attacking you, change your Render Distance to 2, despawning it (can turn up after)
	Craft Gold Boots to be safe in Bastions, 4 Gold Ingot (36 Gold Nuggets)
	Bastions cannot spawn in a Basalt Delta Biome
	All Bastions besides Treasure can spawn a Triple Chest top section, to tell them apart;
		if there are 2 Blocks between the Double/Single Chest, then it's Stables
		if there are 3 Blocks, then it can be either Housing or Bridge (should be easy to tell them apart)
	Mobs spawn more often in Soul Sand Valleys, so if a Fortress is located in one, 5RD is pretty risky
	
The Overworld 2: Triangulation + Stronghold
	When travelling in water, it is faster to use a Dolphin boost, than it would be to use a Boat
	if you find an underwater Stronghold, make sure to look around for the Portal Room before entering
	Strongholds are extremely unlikely to spawn in Swamps (supposedly): https://youtu.be/_rbWryJVEmw?t=1011
	In the Stronghold, Spiral Staircases always lead UP to the Entrance
	Libraries lead nowhere, if you enter a Library from the Starter Staircase, turn around
		if you need more Beds, you can gather string from Library Cobwebs (use a Sword or Shears, 20s -> 0.4s)

The End:
	The Dragon's Fireball doesn't do damage, the AoE ground effect does;
		an easy way to avoid the damage, is to get hit on purpose, then jump -> place a block below you


Practice: Ideally, get comfortable with each of these steps before starting runs
	Beginning Overworld Movement: 3 Wood -> 12 Planks -> Crafting Table + 8 Sticks
		Wood(1) -> sClick Planks -> Planks(`), bR -> Split -> Drag bR, bL, tL -> Left Click tR -> collect, sClick x2;
			Crafting: https://i.imgur.com/pzABDu2.png | Demonstration: https://youtu.be/TeFeMmjoUIc?t=28
	Place Table -> Craft Wood Pick -> Mine 6 Stone -> 
		Stick(f), bM -> Split, lClick mM -> Plank(1), tL -> Split -> Drag tM, tR -> collect, F

	Craft Stone Axe + Shovel + Hoe
		Stick(2), bM -> Split, lClick mM -> Stone(3), tM -> Split -> rClick mL -> lClick tL -> Collect, R -> 4 -> 5

	Collect Table -> Farm Wood (Normally:8) -> Planks -> 4 Sticks
	Kill Golem -> Table -> Iron Pick -> Boat -> Collect Table

	Village: Identify which Houses have Beds (and Carpets)
	Nether Portal Construction, +Flintless Portal

	Bastion: Identification + Routing, for all 4 Types
		Microlensing: Locate Bastion direction from Nether spawn
	Fortress: General Navigation, be able to quickly find the outside portion of the Fortress
		Pie-Ray: Locate Fortress drection from the Bastion, (also useful to find Villages)
	Blind Travel: Try to remember the general locations of the 1st/2nd Ring Coordinates

	Triangulation: Quick 90° turn + Consistent 17.5 Block Jumps, Fast Menuing
	Stronghold: Optimal Navigation, do a lot of stronghold trial solves (random -> starter -> portal)
	Dragon: 1 Cycle (N/S Perch), <=7 Beds, with Obsidian and Full Block/Slab setups (no obby backup)
